I have my mom, dad, step-dad, brother, and boyfriend of five years so he's part of the fam at this point. My boyfriend, Edgar, and I have known each other sense elementary school but started dating Sophomore year of high school. Here are some random/interesting facts about me: </p>

	<li>Like every girl, I have an obsession with shoes.</li>
	<li><i>The Office</i> is my favorite show of all time.</li>
	<li>I played soccer when I was a kid and loved it and was average at it.</li>
	<li>Math is my favorite subject in school.</li>
	<li>I'm shy and have a hard time making friends</li>

</ul>

<p> I am a Fashion Merchandising student at the University of Georgia. I am a third year but, this fall is my first semester at UGA.Before I transferred to UGA I went to Georgia Highlands College. It is a four-year school. I went there straight out of high school and only took core education classes there.I transferred after two years because GHC didn't offer my major and UGA is one of the few schools in Georgia that offer my major. UGA was the best fit for me.  I'm enjoying all of the classes this semester. Some of them are difficult but, I am enjoying all of them in their own ways. Unfortunately, I have to go to class five days a week. I haven't done that sense high school. Below is my class schedule for this semester. It's not as crazy as it looks. </p>

<p> I'm sure you can tell by now that I LOVE FASHION! Fashion was my first interest in life. I've loved it sense I was a kid. My mom was the first person that got me interested in fashion. I loved the way she dressed and I loved everything in her closet. I use to try on all of her clothes while she wasn't home. I would always have a big mess to clean up when I was done. My mom is the one that helped shape my personal style. My personal style today is a mix of a little bit of everything. I like to be trendy, edgy, boho, girly, and a tomboy every once in a while. I love pairing dresses with heavy outerwear, skirts with sneakers, and distressed jeans with girly, flowy tops. Here are some of my favorite items in my closet:</p>

	<dt>Tops</dt>
